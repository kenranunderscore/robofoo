;; A robot consists of the the following:
;; - A function to create some self-managed state given its initial
;;   game-assigned robot-state. Signature: robot-state -> 'a.
;; - A function to react to a new game tick event. Signature:
;;   tick-event -> robot-state -> 'a -> ('a, action) (FIXME: no action yet).
;; - A color with which it is drawn.
